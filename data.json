    "I am a self-taught <span class=\"age\"></span> years old male and have been learning and making web sites for about 20 years as a hobby.",
    "In the beginning it was mostly graphics created in Photoshop, then I learned some PHP and used it for functional programming. I didn't know object-oriented programming at the time.",
    "In my last job I created a web application for the company, a document store/search and blog. This is when I learned SQL, Javascript and C#. Created my own search engine that I eventually replaced with Apache Solr. It worked, but it wasn't any good.",
    "When I didn't do technical support I used my time to write, this is how I learned. I liked writing code better than my other job tasks. Also wrote SQL scripts and some small software tools.",
    "Understands computer architecture and how software works (C, C++, Stack, Heap, Memory pointers, Dynamic Linking,  etc). Played around with electronic components and a micro-controller board for a while and made a LED matrix, then I got tired of it.",
    "I learned a lot in my last job and from the internet (Youtube, MIT Open Courseware, Microsoft Virtual Academy, Google etc)",
    "After I lost my job I discovered cryptocurrency and Ethereum the decentralized world computer and Swarm decentralized peer-to-peer storage. A platform for creating decentralized web applications on a blockchain. I liked the idea to be able to write a static web application that is completely in the hands of the users and is hosted on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. I had some ideas for applications on the platform and started writing an app where users are incentivised with cryptocurrency to share audio samples and discovered it's limitations... ",
    "I'm a life long learner and have had an interest in computing since I got my first computer when I was about 16 years old."
